# IN-PROGRESS

My attempt at writing an AST-walking interpreter for a toy programming language called Decaf.
This language was originally developed for 6.035 at MIT.
I'm currently implementing this interpreter for heavily modified version of this, originally develoed by Mike Lam at James Madison University.

I don't actually attend James Madison University. However, Mike Lam's documentation for his modified language is fantanstic. So, I decided to write an interpreter for hos language as a fun side project.
