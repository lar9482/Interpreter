# IN-PROGRESS

My attempt at writing an AST-walking interpreter for a toy programming language called Decaf.
This language was originally developed for 6.035 at MIT.
I'm currently implementing this interpreter for a simplified version of the language, originally developed by Mike Lam at James Madison University.

I don't actually attend James Madison University. However, Mike Lam's documentation for his modified language is fantastoc. So, I decided to write an interpreter for his language as a fun side project.
